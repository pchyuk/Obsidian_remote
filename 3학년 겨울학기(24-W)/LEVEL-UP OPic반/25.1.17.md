영작 퀴즈..

사실은 어제 스타벅스에 갔었어요. 밤늦게 9시 30분쯤?
- Actually, I went to starbucks yesterday. Late at night, probably nine thirty?

서울에 차를 타고 가는 중이었어요. 3시쯤?
I was going to seoul with a car. maybe three (o'clock)?

의외로 차가 완전히 많았어요. 6시쯤 겨우 도착했어요. 완전 지치더라고요.
Surprisingly, there are so many cars. seriously. I barely arrive at six. It was totally exhausting(I was totally exhausted)

솔직히 쉬고싶었는데... 바로 저녁을 먹으러 갔습니다.
Honestly, I want to take a break... but I went to eat dinner right away.

진짜 맛있더라고요.
It was amazingly delicious.
