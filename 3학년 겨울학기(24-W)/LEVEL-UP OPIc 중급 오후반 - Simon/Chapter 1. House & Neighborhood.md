### 묘사하기 - MP 2개

Well, I live in a big apartment. It has four room, but honestly, It's perfect for me right now.
First of all, you know, my bed, desk, and living room are all in one space. 
The bed is right next to the window, so I get nice sunlight during the day, which I love.
Whenever I lie down on my bed, I feel incredibly cozy and comfortable.
And my desk! It's pretty big and wide, so It works for studying or, you know, using my fantastic computer and laptop.
Secondly, there is a living room with television and a sofa. 
Honestly, It's not big, but it's enough for get some rest.
Oh, and I also have a closet where I keep all my clothes and other stuff.
So yeah, this is pretty much about my house.

친구들이랑 볼링친 썰

Okay, Let me tell you about a memorable experience that happened in my neighborhood. 
Whenever I meet my hometown friends, we often go bowling. 
My friends are quite good at bowling, so we always have a great time. 
To make the game a bit more exciting and tense, we usually place a small bet. 
The person with the lowest score among us has to buy a drink for the person with the highest score.

So, in order not to lose the bet, everyone tries their best to get the highest score possible. 
One time, I scored the highest among my friends, and my score was a whopping 178! 
This was my personal best, and thanks to that, I got to enjoy a free drink from a friend. 
Every time I think of this experience, it brings a smile to my face. That day was truly perfect.
