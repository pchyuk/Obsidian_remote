I usually listen to music when I'm relaxing in my room and while I'm traveling on the bus.

First of all, I love listening to music in my room with my computer and speakers. Being able to enjoy my favorite music in my own space without any interruptions is truly amazing, don't you think? When I'm sitting in my chair or lying on my bed, feeling comfortable and listening to music, it helps me relieve stress and makes me feel like I have the whole world. In that moment, I can fully focus on the music without any worries or concerns. I really cherish this time.

What else... Oh right, I also enjoy listening to music on the bus. I usually take public transportation when I'm going to school, my part-time job, or hanging out with friends, and the travel time can be quite long. Especially when going to school, it takes about an hour from home to campus, and during this time, I listen to music with my wireless Bluetooth earphones. As I mentioned earlier, I really enjoy listening to music, so the time spent on the bus isn't too bad. In fact, I quite enjoy it!

This is how I enjoy music. These activities make my day a bit more enjoyable.
