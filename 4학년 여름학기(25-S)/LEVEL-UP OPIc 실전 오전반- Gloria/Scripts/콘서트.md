Let me tell you about the only concert I've ever been to, which was two years ago in the spring.

I went to Seoul with three of my friends to see the singer Bolbbalgan4 (BOL4). She is quite a famous band singer in Korea. 

I usually enjoy listening to her songs because they sometimes make me excited and other times comfort me. When I first saw the concert hall, I was amazed by the grandeur of the stage setup. Once the concert started, I was even more blown away by the live atmosphere. I couldn't believe I had been missing out on something so fun and exciting!

The concert's atmosphere, the mood of the day, and the memories with my friends – everything about that day was perfect. I was deeply impressed and vowed to attend more concerts in the future.

That day is one of the happiest and most unforgettable moments in my life. I still smile whenever I think about it.
