I saw a Netflix animation 2 weeks ago. 

Actually, I don’t usually watch Netflix, but I started watching it because my friend strongly recommend it. The name of the animation that I watched is “Kpop Demon Hunters”. My friend told me that this was really, really funny, so I watched it, and WOW! this REALLY shocked me.

The content of the animation was good enough, but what really surprised me the most was, the MUSIC! Every single song in the anime is so great that I listen to it all the time these days, such as when I’m taking a shower or walking through the other place. Other songs are good, but the song I recommend the most from this anime is “What it Sounds Like”. You should DEFINITELY listen to this song. Seriously! I guarantee it.

If I get a chance, I’d like to watch this anime again. It gave me a pleasant shock.
