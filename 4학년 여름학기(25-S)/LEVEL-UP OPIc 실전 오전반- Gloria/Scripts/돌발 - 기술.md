## Q: Tell me about a time when you had a problem while using new technology. Maybe your computer was not working properly, or your cell phone lost its service. Give me as many details as you can.

Okay, I once had a problem with the air conditioner that I bought. It stopped cooling properly after just a week.

The reason it happened was because there was a leak in the system. I mean, I was really disappointed since it was brand new.

When it stopped working, I call customer service, and they sent a technician to check it. They found the problem and fixed it under warrenty. It took a few days, but at least the issue was resolved.

Phew.. It was frustrating at first, but now the air conditioner works properly, and I'm happy with it.
