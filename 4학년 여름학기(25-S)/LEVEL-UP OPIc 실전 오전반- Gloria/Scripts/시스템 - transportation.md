Let me tell you about the [transportation] system in Korea.

So, One thing I can say for sure is that Korea has a very well-designed and organized [transportation] system. In most neighborhoods, you can easily find [various public vehicles, such as a bus, a subway and any other else]. (In my case, I usually use buses because it’s price is so reasonable and quite convenient in most cases.)

Many foreigners I’ve met were surprised by how detailed and strict the system is. They often say that it’s much more advanced than the [transportation] systems in their home countries. I remember one of my international friends saying. “Wow, in Korea, [no one cuts in line when waiting for a bus!]” thought that was pretty funny, but also true.

As a Korean, I feel quite proud of the system. It really shows how much we care about [the traffic laws] Of course, it can be a bit confusing for newcomers, once you get used to it, it becomes second nature.

So overall, I think Korea’s [transportation] system is something we can be proud of, and it definitely leaves a good impression on visitors.
