Let me tell you about the [recycling] system in Korea.

So, One thing I can say for sure is that Korea has a very well-designed and organized [recycling] system. In most neighborhoods, you can easily find [designated bins for different types of waste-like paper, plastic, glass, food waste and general trash]. (There are also specific collection days for certain items, and signs are posted to help people sort things correctly.)

Many foreigners I’ve met were surprised by how detailed and strict the system is. They often say that it’s much more advanced than the [recycling] systems in their home countries. I remember one of my international friends saying. “Wow, in Korea, [even food waste gets collected separately!]” thought that was pretty funny, but also true.

As a Korean, I feel quite proud of the system. It really shows how much we care about [the environment] Of course, it can be a bit confusing for newcomers, once you get used to it, it becomes second nature.

So overall, I think Korea’s [recycling] system is something we can be proud of, and it definitely leaves a good impression on visitors.
