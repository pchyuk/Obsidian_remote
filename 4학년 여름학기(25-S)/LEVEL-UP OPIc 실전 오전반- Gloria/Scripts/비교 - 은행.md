Well... let me think, ... umm...

도입) so.. you know... [banking system] has changed dramatically over the years, so let me compare [the bank] in the past and the present.

과거) so, in the past, there was a lack of [ATMs] in Korea, so people used to suffer from it. They had to spend great deal of time on waiting in order to [withdraw some money] which was wery inconvenient. In other words, supply could never meet the people demands.

현재) But as for the present, thanks to the effort from the government and society, the number of [the ATM] has increased dramatically so it takes less time and effort to [do banking business.]

+덧붙여) Plus, due to the rapid development of technology, [banking] online has become much more convenient and easier to access since we even have apps for [sending and depositing ]

마무리) So, these are the differences of [banking system] between the past and the present.
