## Q. Please describe a healthy person you know of. What does she or he look like? Tell me everything about the things that make that person healthy.

When it comes to my favorite [healthy person], one things is that I first got to know him when I was [23]. I first met him in the department building, and found out that he was a classmate of mine and that he really liked working out and was good at it. That's how we first met.

Another thing is that you know, one thing I really admire about [him] is how discipline he is. (has high standards.) He/She works out regularly and follows a healthy, balanced diet. He's very consistent and takes
great care of himself, both physically and mentally. Thanks to him, I've become more motivated to work out and take better care of my own health as well.

And the last thing is that I can guarantee that he is the most dilligent and talented person I've even seen in my entire life. Whether it's work or personal goals, he always puts in his best effort and never gives up easily. he's also very creative and smart, which makes him stand out in everything she does.
