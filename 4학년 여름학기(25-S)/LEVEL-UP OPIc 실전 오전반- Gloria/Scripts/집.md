Okay, let me tell you about my small but cozy place :)

Actually, I live alone in a studio apartment near the school.

My major is software, so I have a lot of electronic devices in my room, such as umm… a fancy laptop, some cute speakers and other gadgets I use for studying and coding.

Since I spend most of my day in the department building, I mostly use my room for just taking a shower, eating some foods, and taking some rest. And well… honestly, I spend a lot of time just sleeping.  
  
Aside from sleeping, My favorite thing to do at home is watching Youtube! Of course just watching youtube itself is also great and interesting, but with my amazing monitor and speakers, It makes me feel more fun and excited! And plus, I have a large tablet and tablet supporter next to my bed, so I can lie down and watch youtube! That’s insane! I LOVE IT!

Yeah, that’s pretty much about my house.
