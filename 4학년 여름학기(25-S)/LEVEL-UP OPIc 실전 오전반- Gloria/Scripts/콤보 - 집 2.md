## 1. 집 묘사
### Q: I would like to know about where you live. Do you live in a house or an apartment? How many rooms do you have? Which is your favorite room? Why do you like that room?

Well, I live in a small studio apartment. It's just one room, but honestly, It's perfect for me right now.

First of all, you know, my bed, my desk, and kitchen are all in one space. The bed is right next to the window, so I get nice sunlight during the day, which I love. And my desk! It's pretty small, but it works for studying or, you know, using my fantastic laptop.

Secondly, there's a tiny kitchen with a sink and a microwave. To be honest, it's not big, but it's enough for cooking simple meals. Oh, and I also have a closet where I keep all my clothes and other stuff.

So yeah, this is pretty much about my house.

## 2. 집에서 하는 활동
### Q: Can you tell me about the things that you usually do at home? Tell me your daily routines and activities. What is special about each activity?

Okay, let me tell you about my small but cozy place :)

Actually, I live alone in a studio apartment near the school.

My major is software, so I have a lot of electronic devices in my room, such as umm… a fancy laptop, some cute speakers and other gadgets I use for studying and coding.

Since I spend most of my day in the department building, I mostly use my room for just taking a shower, eating some foods, and taking some rest. And well… honestly, I spend a lot of time just sleeping.  
  
Aside from sleeping, My favorite thing to do at home is watching Youtube! Of course just watching youtube itself is also great and interesting, but with my amazing monitor and speakers, It makes me feel more fun and excited! And plus, I have a large tablet and tablet supporter next to my bed, so I can lie down and watch youtube! That’s insane! I LOVE IT!

Yeah, that’s pretty much about my house.

## 3. 집에서 발생한 문제들
### Q: Tell me about the problems you have experienced at your place. Maybe things have broken down, or have not worked properly. What were those problems? How did you deal with those problems?

오케이. 내가 절대로 까먹을 수 없는, 아주 기억에 남는 기억을 말해 줄게.
내 자취방 바로 옆 방에는 1살 형인 같은 과 선배가 살고 있어.
그와 나는 아주 친해서, 같이 놀러도 다니고, 사실 내가 살고 있는 내 방도 이 형이 추천해 줘서 살게 되었어.
- Okay. I'll tell you a very memorable memory that I will never forget. The room right next to my studio is my senior in the same department who is one year older than me. We are very close, so we hang out together, and in fact, the room I live in was recommended to me by my older brother.

약 2달 전쯤인가? 꽤 늦은 저녁이었어. 내가 방에서 샤워를 하고 있는데, 내가 음악을 듣는 것을 아주 좋아하거든. 샤워할 때도 마찬가지야. 나는 주로 샤워할 때 나의 블루투스 스피커로 노래를 틀어 놓고 씻는 편인데, 평소에는 내가 낮이나 오후에 씻는 편이고, 그날따라 내가 신이 많이 났는지 스피커로 노래를 꽤 크게 틀었고, 심지어는 음악을 크게 따라 부르기까지 했어. ...다시 말하지만, 그때는 꽤 늦은 저녁이었어. 아마 자정이 넘었을 거야..
- About 2 months ago? It was quite late at night. I was taking a shower in my room, and I really like listening to music. It's the same when I shower. I usually play music on my Bluetooth speaker while I shower, and I usually shower during the day or afternoon, and I was really excited that day, so I played the music on my speaker quite loudly, and I even sang along to the music loudly. ... Again, it was quite late at night. It was probably past midnight.

내가 살고 있는 건물은 방음이 잘 안 되기 때문에, 나의 시끄러운 노랫소리는 옆 방 형이 듣기에 충분했어. 바로 다음 날 내가 형을 만났을 때 형이 얘기해주기를 "너 어제 밤에 씻으면서 노래 부르더라.. 밤에 너무 시끄러워서, 나는 상당히 화가 났었고, 따끔하게 얘기해 줘야지 마음먹고 밖에 나왔는데 소리가 나는 곳이 너의 방이더라. 그래서 그냥 조용히 방으로 들어왔어." 라고 말하더라고..
- The building I live in doesn't have good soundproofing, so my loud singing was enough for my brother in the next room to hear. The next day, when I met him, he told me, "You were singing while you were washing last night. It was so noisy at night, I got really angry, and I decided to tell you a harsh thing, so I went outside, but the sound was coming from your room. So I just quietly went back into my room."

그때의 나는, 형에게 정말 너무 미안하고 너무 부끄러워서, 연신 사과를 함과 동시에 당장이라도 쥐구멍에 들어가서 숨고 싶었어. 내가 이런 실수를 하다니! 다행히도 형은 웃으면서 내 사과를 받아 주었고, 그 이후로 나는 절대로, 절대로 화장실에서 노래를 부르지 않아. 물론, 부르지만 않고, 노래는 여전히 계속 듣긴 해. 당연히 소리는 좀 줄이고, 지금처럼 너무 늦은 저녁에는 노래를 틀지 않지. 지금도 가끔 형은 나를 만나면 웃으면서 그때의 얘기를 꺼내고, 나는 그때마다 고개를 떨구면서 형에게 미안하다고 해.
- At that time, I was so sorry and embarrassed to my brother, and I wanted to apologize over and over again and immediately hide in a hole. How could I have made such a mistake! Fortunately, my brother accepted my apology with a smile, and since then, I never, ever sing in the bathroom. Of course, I don't sing, but I still listen to the music. Of course, I turn the volume down a bit, and I don't play the music so late at night like now. Even now, when I see my brother sometimes, he laughs and talks about that time, and every time I hang my head and apologize to him.

좋아. 이게 나의 아주 특별하고도 부끄러운 경험이었어. 나는 절대로 이 일을 잊지 못 할 것 같고, 또한 반성하고 있어.
- Okay. This was a very special and embarrassing experience of mine. I don't think I'll ever forget it, and I'm reflecting on it.
