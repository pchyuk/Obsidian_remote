Well... let me think, ... umm...

도입) so.. you know... [my house's nearby] has changed dramatically over the years, so let me compare [my hometown] in the past and the present.

과거) so, in the past, there was a lack of [cultural facilities like movie theater] in Korea, so people used to suffer from it. They had to spend great deal of time on waiting in order to [see a movie] which was wery inconvenient. In other words, supply could never meet the people demands.

현재) But as for the present, thanks to the effort from the government and society, the number of [the facility] has increased dramatically so it takes less time and effort to [활동]

+덧붙여) Plus, due to the rapid development of technology, [-ing] online has become much more convenient and easier to access since we even have apps for [booking tickets and looking for information stuff like that~]
