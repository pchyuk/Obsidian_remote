I found a better price somewhere else. Do you have a price match guarantee?
Can you refund me the difference? 차액 받을 수 있나요?
You give me score credit? That's so kind of you!
Hi I recently bought a recliner sofa, but the leg seat doesn't work.
I'd prefer a replacement. If not, could I get a refund instead?
