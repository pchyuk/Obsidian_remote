### scripts
When it comes to my favorite [인물], one things is that I first got to know her when I was [25]. At the time, I had just started going to the gym, and I happened to see her there. That's how we first met.

Another thing is that you know, one thing I really admire about [인물] is how discipline she is. (has high standards.) He/She works out regularly and follows a healthy, balanced diet. He/She's very consistent and takes
great care of him/herself, both physically and mentally. Thanks to him/her, I've become more motivated to work out and take better care of my own health as well.

And the last thing is that I can guarantee that she is the most dilligent and talented person I've even seen in my entire life. Whether it's work or personal goals, he/she always puts in her best effort and never gives up easily. he/she's also very creative and smart, which makes her stand out in everything she does.
