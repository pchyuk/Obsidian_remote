1) Alright, I have one. OR
2) Sorry, I don't think I have the same experience to your question, ...ummmm, But let me tell you when something didn't go as I planned.

A few weeks ago, I had a chance to go to a hotel because it was one of my friends' birthday party. It was so special day that I booked a hotel dinner for her. Actually there's a luxurious hotel ==down the road== and I wanted to go there so badly.

Anyway, I booked online and visited the hotel on the day. But, you know what? The staff told me that I was not on the list! I thought I checked my reservation several times but you know, he was like "No." So I was so embarrassed and sorry to her. Even though she said she's okay but you know, I was terribly sorry. And it ruined everything I planned for her.

So, we ended up trying somewhere else and that was actually also a nice place. The food was marvelous, the atmosphere was so lively. We had enjoyable time and she liked it but I would never forget that experience and never make the same mistake!

### My scripts
1달 전에(A month ago) 친구들과 함께 대만 여행을 갔는데
- A month ago, My friends and I were going to the trip to Taiwan,

한 친구가 연구실 일정(lab schedule) 때문에 우리보다 하루 먼저 비행기를 타고 한국으로 돌아가야 했음.
- But one of my friends had to fly back to Korea a day before us due to his lab schedule.

일정이 중간에 수정(changed)된 거여서, 1. 원래 함께 가기로 했던 비행기 표를 취소하고, 2. 새로운 비행기 표를 예약해야 했는데, 기존 표(previous ticket)를 취소하는 데는 생각보다 수수료(fee)가 많이 발생했고, 새로운 비행기 표는 빈 자리를 찾기 쉽지 않았음.
- Since the schedule was changed in the middle, 1. I had to cancel the flight tickets I was originally supposed to take, and 2. I had to book a new flight ticket. However, the cancellation fee for the existing ticket was higher than I thought, and it was not easy to find an empty seat on the new flight.

나와 내 친구들은 먼저 돌아가야 하는 친구를 위해 함께 최선을 다해 비행기 티켓을 찾아보았고, 다행히도 적당한 가격에 괜찮은 비행기 자리를 구할 수 있었음.
- My friends and I tried our best to find plane tickets together for our friend who had to go back first, and luckily we were able to get decent seats at a reasonable price.

아주 memorable한 experience 였음.
- It was the memorable experience that I've ever had.
