1) Alright, I have one. OR
2) Sorry, I don't think I have the same experience to your question, ...ummmm, But let me tell you when something didn't go as I planned.

A few weeks ago, I had a chance to go to a hotel because it was one of my friends' birthday party. It was so special day that I booked a hotel dinner for her. Actually there's a luxurious hotel ==down the road== and I wanted to go there so badly.

Anyway, I booked online and visited the hotel on the day. But, you know what? The staff told me that I was not on the list! I thought I checked my reservation several times but you know, he was like "No." So I was so embarrassed and sorry to her. Even though she said she's okay but you know, I was terribly sorry. And it ruined everything I planned for her.

So, we ended up trying somewhere else and that was actually also a nice place. The food was marvelous, the atmosphere was so lively. We had enjoyable time and she liked it but I would never forget that experience and never make the same mistake!

### My scripts
- 친구들과 함께 대만 여행을 갔는데
- 한 친구가 연구실 일정 때문에 우리보다 하루 먼저 비행기를 타고 한국으로 돌아가야 했음.
- 일정이 중간에 수정된 거여서, 1. 원래 함께 가기로 했던 비행기 표를 취소하고, 2. 새로운 비행기 표를 예약해야 했는데, 기존 표를 취소하는 데는 생각보다 수수료가 많이 발생했고, 새로운 비행기 표는 빈 자리를 찾기 쉽지 않았음.
- 나와 내 친구들은 먼저 돌아가야 하는 친구를 위해 함께 최선을 다해 비행기 티켓을 찾아보았고, 다행히도 적당한 가격에 괜찮은 비행기 자리를 구할 수 있었음.
- 아주 memorable한 experience 였음.
